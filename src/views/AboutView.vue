                hobby but when the cabinets at home were full I started selling
                them and haven't stopped since. The first years the sales were
                minimal but in 2023 my sales increased so much that I started
                designing a webshop through Shopify and got a KVK. Now I still
                work on this and try to expand my shop with different products
                like sublimation mugs, dice making and more glasses, I'm only
                still struggling with marketing and social media content. Other
                than that I love to be creative in my free time (without making

                or painting with numbers.
